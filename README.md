## Installation
Within the 'db' folder, copy the contents of the schema.sql file and paste them into the MYSQL workbench. Run the command and the database will be created. In the folder that contains server.js, open the terminal and input:

npm install

The necessary node modules will all be installed. Next, the database is seeded with the following command:
 
node seeds/seed

Now that the database is created and seeded, initialize the application with the command:
 
'node server'

The application is now installed and functional.
  
  
## Usage
 By following the installation instructions, the application should be runnning. API requests can now be made and the server will respond with the corresponding data. There are  GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE  requests for each endpoint. The endpoints are /api/categories , api/products, and api/tags . A simple GET request with no request body at any endpoint will return all items for that endpoint. To get an item with a specific ID, add the ID number to the endpoint as shown below:
 
 http://localhost:3001/api/categories/1
 
 To POST a new category, the "category_name" parameter must be present in the request body:

 Similarly, to POST a new tag, the "tag_name" parameter must be present.

To POST a new product, several parameters must be preset:

For PUT requests, category and tag request bodies stay the same as their POST counterparts, however an ID number must be added after the corresponding endpoint:

 THe PUT for product only takes the ID number after the endpoint and the "product_name" parameter in the request body. DELETE requests only require the ID of the unwanted item after the endpoint:
